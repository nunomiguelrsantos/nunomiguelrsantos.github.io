		It was either this or watching films but I was more inclined at the beginning of this assigment to add a song to this project. In the impossible task of deciding which song to use, I randomly picked one from a personal playlist of favourite songs. I have listen to this song in repeat while doing this assigment and now I don't want to listen to it anymore. I think I just want now to sit by myself and go watch a movie. Anyway, this song is called... <br/>

				That's how it starts<br/>
				We go back to your house<br/>
				You check the charts<br/>
				And start to figure it out<br/>
				And if it's crowded, all the better<br/>
				Because we know we're gonna be up late<br/>
				But if you're worried about the weather<br/>
				Then you picked the wrong place to stay<br/>
				That's how it starts<br/>
				And so it starts<br/>
				You switch the engine on<br/>
				We set controls for the heart of the sun<br/>
				One of the ways we show our age<br/>
				And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up<br/>
				And I still don't wanna stagger home<br/>
				Then it's the memory of our betters<br/>
				That are keeping us on our feet<br/>
				You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan<br/>
				And the next five years trying to be with your friends again<br/>
				You're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can<br/>
				Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend<br/>
				It comes apart<br/>
				The way it does in bad films<br/>
				Except the part<br/>
				Where the moral kicks in<br/>
				Though when we're running out of the drugs<br/>
				And the conversation's winding away<br/>
				I wouldn't trade one stupid decision<br/>
				For another five years of life<br/>
				You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can<br/>
				And the next ten people who are trying to be polite<br/>
				When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France<br/>
				Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?<br/>
				And to tell the truth<br/>
				Oh, this could be the last time<br/>
				So here we go<br/>
				Like a sales force into the night<br/>
				And if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool<br/>
				On the road, there's always this<br/>
				And if I'm sewn into submission<br/>
				I can still come home to this<br/>
				And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand<br/>
				You can sleep on the plane or review what you said<br/>
				When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned<br/>
				You think over and over, "Hey, I'm finally dead"<br/>
				Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand<br/>
				You can turn it on yourself, you ridiculous clown<br/>
				You forgot what you meant when you read what you said<br/>
				And you always knew you were tired, but then<br/>
				Where are your friends tonight?<br/>
				Where are your friends tonight?<br/>
				Where are your friends tonight?<br/>
				If I could see all my friends tonight<br/>
				If I could see all my friends tonight<br/>
				If I could see all my friends tonight<br/>
				If I could see all my friends tonight<br/>

	"So, then, in celebration of paradoxes. "All My Friends" is happy and it's sad. It's naive, but also disillusioned. It can make you feel twenty again. It makes you feel forty before your time. It makes you feel twenty and forty at once. It spirals into drug-fueled escapism, and it spirals into nostalgia. It's mature. It's the sound of sobering up. It's the song you play as the party peaks. It's the song you put on headphones when you walk home in the early hours of the morning, and some nights you triumphantly reminisce about all the experiences of your life, but maybe the edges are haunted and just as you step up to your front door and Murphy's last refrain echoes "If I could see all my friends tonight" you also know you're searching, too, that you feel all the dejection and isolation that've been as much a part of these last thirteen years as a new online version of community, or as much as anything else. It's a song about 1987 and 1997 and 2007 and probably 2017. Even weighed down by all of this, it still moves. And because we have no other option, because this is our new millennium life: We still move, too."</p>
