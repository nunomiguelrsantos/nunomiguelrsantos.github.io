      On the beach at night alone,<br>
      As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song,<br>
      As I watch the bright stars shining, I think a thought of the clef of the universes and of the future.</p>
      <p>
      A vast similitude interlocks all,<br>
      All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,<br>
      All distances of place however wide,<br>
      All distances of time, all inanimate forms,<br>
      All souls, all living bodies though they be ever so different, or in different worlds,<br>
      All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes, the fishes, the brutes,<br>
      All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages,<br>
      All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe, or any globe,<br>
      All lives and deaths, all of the past, present, future,<br>
      This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann'd,<br>
      And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them.</p>
