      Beat! beat! drums! blow! bugles! blow!<br>
      Through the windows through doors burst like a ruthless force,<br>
      Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,<br>
      Into the school where the scholar is studying,<br>
      Leave not the bridegroom quiet no happiness must he have now with his bride,<br>
      Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his grain,<br>
      So fierce you whirr and pound you drums so shrill you bugles blow.</p>
      <p>
      Beat! beat! drums! blow! bugles! blow!<br>
      Over the traffic of cities over the rumble of wheels in the streets;<br>
      Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must sleep in those beds,<br>
      No bargainers' bargains by day no brokers or speculators would they continue?<br>
      Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?<br>
      Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?<br>
      Then rattle quicker, heavier drums you bugles wilder blow.</p>
      <p>
      Beat! beat! drums! blow! bugles! blow!<br>
      Make no parley stop for no expostulation,<br>
      Mind not the timid mind not the weeper or prayer,<br>
      Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,<br>
      Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties,<br>
      Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses,<br>
      So strong you thump O terrible drums so loud you bugles blow.</p>
