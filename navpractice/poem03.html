      <p>
      O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,<br>
      The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br>
      The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>
      While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;<br>
                               But O heart! heart! heart!<br>
                                  O the bleeding drops of red,<br>
                                     Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>
                                        Fallen cold and dead.</p>
      <p>
      O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br>
      Rise up for you the flag is flung for you the bugle trills,<br>
      For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths for you the shores a-crowding,<br>
      For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br>
                               Here Captain! dear father!<br>
                                  This arm beneath your head!<br>
                                     It is some dream that on the deck,<br>
                                       You've fallen cold and dead.</p>
      <p>
      My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<br>
      My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,<br>
      The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,<br>
      From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;<br>
                               Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br>
                                  But I with mournful tread,<br>
                                     Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>
                                        Fallen cold and dead.</p>
