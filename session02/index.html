Stormvoel, <b><i> 5 stars. </i></b> <br> <span class="product">"Best deal on a great gift - for restaurant servers"<br> </span> I've been trying to write with rollerball pens, but they're awful: the ink in them clumps and smears, and it makes a mess of your fingers and the paper. I finally tossed them all out and bought a box of 60 Bic Sticks. What a relief! No more smearing in my check register (or on my checks), no ink running all over the place. Just a good, solid, basic pen that does what it should: it writes smoothly, period. And it's not pricey to get a lot of them, either.</p>

<p>
S., <b><i> 2 stars. </i></b> <br> <span class="product">"Sent pens in rubber-band bundles"</span> <br> Was sent these pens not in a box, but in rubber-banded bundles? I've used these pens before, they're not great, they're not terrible, they do what I need them to do. But WHY was I sent them in bubble wrapped rubber banded bundles????</p>

<p>
Tirza, <b><i> 1 star. </i></b> <br> <span class="product"> "Pens keep exploding"</span> <br> So far every pen I've used has exploded on me. Very odd. Were they heated too much at some point? This last one was just on my desk - so no abuse and it too exploded very early in the game. Terrible product!</p>

Cassius, <b><i> 5 stars. </i> </b> <br> <span class="product">"BIC is the best"</span> <br> Tried out the BIC Round Stic Xtra Life Ball Point Pen, Black, 36 Pack. The price is great for the number you get. Writing with it is smooth, making it handy for everyday tasks. It's become my top pick for taking notes and getting things done.</p>

<p>
R. Crosslin, <b><i> 4 stars. </i></b> <br> <span class="product">"Great basic pen"</span> <br>The BIC Round Stic Xtra Life Ballpoint Ink Pens have proven to be a reliable choice for everyday writing tasks, earning a solid four-star rating in my book. These pens offer a balance of affordability, durability, and smooth writing performance that make them a staple in my stationery collection. (...) In conclusion, the BIC Round Stic Xtra Life Ballpoint Ink Pens are a dependable choice for everyday writing needs. Their affordability, durability, and smooth writing performance make them a practical option for various tasks. While a cushioned grip would elevate their comfort level, these pens remain a solid choice for those seeking a budget-friendly and reliable writing instrument. For everyday use, I would highly recommend the BIC Round Stic pens, and they have certainly earned their spot on my desk.</p>
